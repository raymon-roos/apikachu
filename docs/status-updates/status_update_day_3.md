Today we started of with another meeting to decide what to do for the day. Jonathan 
tested the user endpoints with mockdata in postman to see if they worked and started
collabing with shazib on the front-end. Raymon made api endpoints for all recources 
and made small updates to documantions. Shazib made a tailwindcss design for the
front-end and tested the database end-points in postman. Gilbert prepared todays 
meetings and worked on documentation. Wessel worked on storing generated images 
and saving words in the database.
