Today, the five of us first heard about the project details: to create a Pokémon themed
api. We summarized the problem statement of our client, researcher Oak, which concerns the
lack of availability of Pokémon data. We will solve this by building a Pokémon database,
accessible through a JSON Rest web API. We will provide extra research value through the
ability to make use of the latest generative AIs to generate hypothetical Pokémon.

To achieve this goal, we first set up a git repo, a Jira scrum board, and our deep-dive
team page. We wrote a project plan document, as well as some user stories. We then made
a start with a blank new Laravel project, using the OpenAI api client, and designing the
database.
